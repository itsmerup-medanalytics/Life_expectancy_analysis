# Life-Expectancy-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global life expectancy trends using health, lifestyle, and socio-economic data collected from the World Health Organization (WHO) and supplemented with socio-economic indicators from the United Nations. The aim is to identify factors influencing life expectancy and provide actionable insights for public health and policy-making.

## Dataset
- **Source:** WHO data repository and UN socio-economic indicators  
- **Records:** 2,938 rows  
- **Variables:** 22 columns including health indicators (adult mortality, infant deaths, HIV/AIDS prevalence, hepatitis B immunization, BMI), lifestyle factors (alcohol consumption), and socio-economic indicators (GDP, schooling, income composition, healthcare expenditure)  
- **Coverage:** Multiple countries across different years

## Analysis Performed
- Explored distributions of life expectancy across countries and years.  
- Analyzed the impact of socio-economic factors like GDP, income composition, and schooling on life expectancy.  
- Studied health indicators including immunization coverage, adult mortality, infant deaths, and HIV/AIDS prevalence.  
- Performed correlation analysis to identify positive and negative influences on life expectancy.  
- Visualized top-performing countries in terms of life expectancy.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python** – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Step-by-step analysis and visualization  
- **Tableau Public** – Interactive dashboards 

## Key Insights & Observations
- **Education:** Schooling shows the strongest positive influence on life expectancy.  
- **Economic Factors:** GDP and income composition are positively associated with life expectancy, highlighting economic stability.  
- **Immunization:** Higher hepatitis B immunization coverage improves life expectancy by reducing preventable diseases.  
- **Mortality:** Adult mortality and infant deaths have a significant negative impact on life expectancy.  
- **HIV/AIDS:** Prevalence shows a strong inverse relationship with life expectancy.  
- **Top Countries:** Japan, Sweden, Canada, Switzerland, and France demonstrate the highest average life expectancy, reflecting effective healthcare systems and public health policies.

## Conclusions
- Socio-economic stability and education significantly contribute to increased life expectancy.  
- Health interventions, such as immunization programs, reduce mortality and extend life expectancy.  
- Addressing high mortality rates and HIV/AIDS prevalence is crucial for improving life expectancy in affected regions.  
- Data-driven insights can guide public health strategies and policy decisions across countries.
